## Re-train GPT In Your Own Style
GPT-2 is trained with a general dataset of knowledge and human conversations. This makes for boring converstaions. Let's teach it to speak in a specific style, manner, or syntax.

### Preparing Your Machine
- Download [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) for your machine (Mac, PC, Linux)
  - Open VS Code 
  - Open the "Extensions" Tab and verify that the Extension [Jupyter](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-toolsai.jupyter) is installed
- Create a folder for your project and open the folder in VS Code.
- Create a filename titled `train.ipynb` in that folder
  - This should open the Jupyter input interface. For example you should see new buttons titled `+Code`, `+Markdown`, `>Run All`
  - This interface is now ready to receive Python commands (see below). Each command is entered step by step into your Jupyter interface. Results at the end of each command will be displayed directly in this window, following which you can enter the next command.

### Preparing Your Dataset
- Text sources (sorry, English only for now)
  - Guttenberg (teach your bot to speak like Virginia Woolf)
- Clean up your text
  - Pattern matching
  - Experment mode: Learn Regex 

### Train Your Bot
- 

## Talking To Your Bot
Now that we have trained our bot with its own style, let's starting talking to it.

### Command Line Prompt
(direct communication with the bot on the command line)

### Simple API Communication
(create a quick server in Python, speak to it from a webpage)

Different ways of speaking to your bot.
- Webpage
- Processing
- P5
- Unity
- Twine
- Godot
- Max/MSP
